# The Ping command is used to test the ability of the source computer to reach a specified destination computer.
# It is to verify that a computer can communicate over the network with another computer or network device.

In command line (as a admin user)
ping -n 5 -l 1500 www.google.com

# above ping command is used to ping the hostname www.google.com.
# The -n option tells the ping command to send 5 ICMP Echo Requests instead of the default of 4, 
# The -l option sets the packet size for each request to 1500 bytes instead of the default of 32 bytes.



# The tracert command is a Command Prompt command that's used to show several details about the path that a packet takes from the computer or device you're on to whatever destination you specify.

In command line/terminal type (as a admin/root user)
tracert -h 10 www.google.com

# we're asking tracert to show us the path from the local computer all the way to the network device with the hostname www.google.com.

# Option -h specifies the maximum number of hops in the search for the target. If you do not specify MaxHops, and a target has not been found by 30 hops, tracert will stop looking.

tracert -d www.google.com
# Option -d is preventing tracert from resolving hostnames. This is often resulting in much faster results.




# nslookup command identifies which DNS server the computer is currently configured to use for its DNS lookups and IP address that your computer is using.

In command line (as a admin user)
nslookup

# small > at the end of the output lets you enter additional parameters

nslookup lifewire.com

# non-authoritative answers" refer to DNS records kept on external DNS servers, which they obtained from the "authoritative" servers that provide the original source of the data.

>set type=ns
>lifewire.com

# An authoritative address lookup can be performed by specifying one of the domain's registered nameservers. nslookup then uses that server instead of the default DNS server information of the local system

nslookup lifewire.com ns1.p30.dynect.net


# The output no longer mentions "non-authoritative" data because the nameserver ns1.p30.dynect is a primary nameserver for Lifewire.com, as listed in the "NS record" portion of its DNS entries.


# Mail Server Lookup

> set type=mx
> lifewire.com
# To search for mail server information on a particular domain, nslookup uses the MX record feature of DNS. Some sites, like Lifewire.com, support both primary and backup servers.
