# The Ping command is used to test the ability of the source computer to reach a specified destination computer.
# It is to verify that a computer can communicate over the network with another computer or network device.

In command line (as a admin user)
ping -n 5 -l 1500 www.google.com

# above ping command is used to ping the hostname www.google.com.
# The -n option tells the ping command to send 5 ICMP Echo Requests instead of the default of 4, 
# The -l option sets the packet size for each request to 1500 bytes instead of the default of 32 bytes.



# The tracert command is a Command Prompt command that's used to show several details about the path that a packet takes from the computer or device you're on to whatever destination you specify.

In command line/terminal type (as a admin/root user)
tracert -h 10 www.google.com

# we're asking tracert to show us the path from the local computer all the way to the network device with the hostname www.google.com.

# Option -h specifies the maximum number of hops in the search for the target. If you do not specify MaxHops, and a target has not been found by 30 hops, tracert will stop looking.

tracert -d www.google.com
# Option -d is preventing tracert from resolving hostnames. This is often resulting in much faster results.




# nslookup command identifies which DNS server the computer is currently configured to use for its DNS lookups and IP address that your computer is using.
